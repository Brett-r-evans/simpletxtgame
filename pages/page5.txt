	as you try to push the large door a smaller door just big enough for a dwarf so the main door is short
	it is also very wide. as you follow a decrepted rug down what is obviously a dwarven throne hall with
	your eyes. at the end you can see a wide stone throne with what is known as a bugbear which is a medium
	size goblinoid creature. as you walk into the room more you see it stand and begin to approach you. you
	quickly deduce that this is the creature who has been harrassing the roads and is the subject of the bounty.
	kill him! just kidding there is nothing and this was all a big waste of time but technically this should be
	a valid final project
