					page 3 into the rabbit hole
	as you squeeze your way through the tunnel, you emerge on the other side in a small 10 by 10 room
	the more you look around you notice this is a kitchen designed for short humanoids. your first thought
	is the goblins might have turned this secret room into a home but then your realize that the fire pit
	and counters are made from a beautiful combination of metal and stone. you begin to realize that this
	could be an ancient dwarven temple. around the camp fire you can see a few freashly killed animals and
	some more of the crates against the wall. you feel a small breeze coming from all side but can only see
	one broze colored metal door. what will you do? be bored enough to continue maybe?
