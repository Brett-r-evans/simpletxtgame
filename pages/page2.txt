					page 2 into the mine
	as you get closer to the bushes, you notice they are blocking the entrence to the mine shaft
	quickly getting through the bushes you find yourself following a mine shaft for about 100ft
	as you reach the end of the tunnel you find the room open up into a 20 by 20 foot room 
	in the center of the room you can see a crude camping spot with a single tent surrounded
	by sleeping spots the size of a goblin. you still wonder what the larger tracks are from.
	on the far wall you notice a small hole broken through the wall leading into another
	dark tunnel. what will you do? something might happen?
