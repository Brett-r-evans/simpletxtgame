	You find yourself holding a ripped bounty note depicting an old destroyed mine shaft.
	Strangley enough, when you found the note you not only reconized the location drawn.
	you also knew it was very close to your current location. you grabbed your gear ready for departure.
	now your crawling through shrubs and brush in the lazy forest only a quarter mile from
	the lazy shaft. upon arriving you find many small tracks surrounding a singluar large set of prints
	all the tracks lead into a mass of shrubs up pressed strangly against the rocks of the mountain
	around, you can see crates scattered around a rusty mine car toppled on its side.
	some crates are intact and sealed closed while others are shattered into peices good for fire.
	what will you do? you see the options right?
