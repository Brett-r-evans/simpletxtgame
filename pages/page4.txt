					page 4 statue hall
	pushing your way through the door, you can see multiple large statues depicting mighty dwarven warriors
	on the ground lies many rusty weapons and pieces of armor around many skelentons roughly the size of dwarven
	people. based on the scene it looks like this was a final stand against an unknown enemy. across the room
	you can see a very large ornimental door with ornate steps leading to the door. what will you do? waste time?
